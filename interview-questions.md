# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. What are props in React?

  Your answer: Props are React properties that are used to pass information between components. Usually props can only be passed one-way from parent to child.

  Researched answer: "Props" is a React keyword that stands for properties. Props are used to pass data from one component to another, but they can only be passed one way (from parent to child). But if you want to pass data from child to parent, you can do that with a technique using "functional props". You can also pass a value from state as a prop, and you can pass methods as props.



2. What is a DOM event?

  Your answer: A DOM event is any event that happens in a web broswser.

  Researched answer: A DOM event is any interaction by the web application with the user, like mouse-clicks, mouse hovering over an element, an image loading, user pressing keys on the keyboard, submitting an HTML form, etc.



3. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: OOP is a style of programming where data is stored in code blocks that contain key/value pairs. Funtional programming is code that's read from top-to-bottom.

  Researched answer: OOP is a programming concept that organizes code and data into 'objects' that are suppossed to represent things, and are self-contained. OOP uses mutable data, functional programming uses immutable data. Statements can be executed in any order in functional programming, as opposed to executing in a particular order in OOP.



4. What is the difference between a Float and an Integer in Ruby?

  Your answer: A float is any number with a decimal point. An integer is just a whole number.

  Researched answer: Integers and floats are 2 seperate data types in Ruby. Integer (also known as int) is a whole number that can be positive or negative. A float represents a number that contains a decimal point. Ruby considers any number with a decimal point to be a float.



5. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: Implicit return means the dev doesn't have to type the return keyword because Ruby already knows it's suppossed to return something.

  Researched answer: The return keyword doesnt have to be explicitly called in Ruby (but can be). An implicit return is when return isnâ€™t explicitly called within a method. Ruby is smart enough to know when a method is suppossed to be returning as truthy.



## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Instance Variable: In an object, it's the value part of the key/value pairs

2. PostgreSQL: An open-source database system that uses the language SQL to manipulate and store data

3. Ruby on Rails: Using Ruby for front-end functionality, and Rails for backend work.

4. ORM: The process of making different data types or systems work together and talk to each other.

5. Active Record: The process that sees if data is being modified so two people can't change data at the same time.
